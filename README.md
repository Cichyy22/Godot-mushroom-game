# The night of mushroom

The night of mushroom was created as a solo project/first ever game by me It was designed 
to be a game that is simple to play but also so that I can learn Godot better.


The basic idea of the game is to collect the right amount of mushrooms (25)
and return home safely without getting caught by anything.
